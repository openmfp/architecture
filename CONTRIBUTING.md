## Overview

# Contributing to openMFP
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.

## The openMFP architecture and design process
To create a RFC or an ADR create a new file in the `adr/` or `rfc/` directory. The file should be named with a number and a short name of the decision/topic. For example, `001-<name>.md` or `001-<name>.md`.

For ADRs, follow the madr ADR template: [template](https://github.com/adr/madr/blob/develop/template/adr-template.md)

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Please ensure your description is
clear and includes sufficient instructions to reproduce the issue.

## License
By contributing to openMFP, you agree that your contributions will be licensed
